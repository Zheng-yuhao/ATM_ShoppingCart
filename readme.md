# Simulating ATM and Shopping

***Environment python 3.8***


 Just a practise project(for my output), you can run the start.py file to start the project.

 In the project, except the basic function of registration and login-in function,
the checking balance, withdraw, repayment, bank transfer, checking bank statements, shopping, checking the shopping-cart are
included.

 There are indeed some places that are redundant. I wish I can improve these codes as soon as possible or maybe in the near future.
