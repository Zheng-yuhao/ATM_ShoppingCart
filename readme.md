# Simulating the ATM and Shopping online

***Environment python :3.8***


  /Just a practise project(for my output), you can run the start.py file to start the project.
 (There have some Chinese words in the source code, ignoring them will not affect your understanding. )

  /In the project, except the basic function of registration and login-in function,
the checking balance, withdraw, repayment, bank transfer, checking bank statements, shopping, checking the shopping-cart are also
included.

  /There are indeed some places that are redundant. I wish I can improve these codes as soon as possible.
